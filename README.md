# Local News Application

This is a responsive, mobile-friendly web-based news application that displays relevant local news to the user using location data from the users IP address. The application includes a filter feature that allows the user to narrow down results or search past articles. It displays a small excerpt of each article with the pulication, date, and a corresponding image.
